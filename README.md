# Felipe's Dotfiles

### By using these dotfiles you'll be able to use a terminal like this one:

### To install it you just have to copy the code down below and paste it on your terminal:

`bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipemeamaral/dotfiles/main/install.sh)"`

#### It has some cool stuff like:

- Show your git branch and commits your project is ahead/behind from origin
- Show node, python, venv, rvm and conda version
- Show battery percentage on Terminal
- Show time delay for every command
- You can add a lot more, like network usage, user name and hostname and so on.

##### If you're running it on a Mac, it'll ask you if you want to install a few other bells and whistles.

##### But they're just a plus, if you don't want to install them, just type `n` when it asks for permission.

##### Hope that you like it.

##### If by any chance you find any bug or have any idea for improvements, just open an issue and we'll discuss what's best the project.
