# Felipe's Dotfiles

### By using these dotfiles you'll be able to use a terminal like this one:

### To install it you just have to copy the code down below and paste it on your terminal:

`bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipemeamaral/dotfiles/main/install.sh)"`

### If you're running it on a Mac, it'll ask you if you want to install a few other bells and whistles.

### But they're just a plus, if you don't want to install them, just type `n` when it asks for permission.

### Hope that you like it.

### If by any chance you just find some improvements, just open an issue and we'll discuss what's best the project.

### Made with ❤️ in 🇧🇷
